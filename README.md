# Pizzabot
The project involved creating a pizza bot using JavaScript. The bot allows users to place orders by interacting with a series of prompts that guide them through selecting their type of food like pizza, pasta or salad. Furthermore, I also added subtype choices. The main goal was to practice JavaScript concepts like if, else if, and else statements, but also switch statements.

With more time, I would add additional features to the bot, such as validating user input, allowing users to customize their orders further with more subchoices for example toppings.
